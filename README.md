# Graceful-Trees
Python code to help with analysing the graceful trees problem
The section on mutations is still a bit of a mess - feel free to look into it and try your hand.
The rest works OK, but may not be optimal. Again, see what you think.

AUGUST 2020
Mutations are working much better, and I'm now writing my unit tests. 

Yeah, I know.

Also tidying up the code.

The current project is looking at spanning trees of the line graph, as a way of getting a handle on the 
entries in the adjacency matrix. My hope was that the determinant of the reduced Laplacian matrix of the 
line graph would yield the number of graceful labellings of the original tree (up to some constant multiple)
but that hasn't worked out.

Excelsior!
